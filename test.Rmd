##
When you 

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

#this is a comment
a <-
    mpg %>% #this is another comment
    mutate(length = nchar(model)) %>% 
    filter(length < 10) %>% 
    group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
    count(model) %>% 
    ungroup()

b <- function(x) {
    if(1 == 1){
        1
    } else {
        2
    }
}

n <- c(2, 3, 5) 
s <- c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
x <- list(n, s, b, 3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
