##
When you 

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

model_name <- "a4"

#this is a comment
a <-
    mpg %>% #this is another comment
    mutate(ideal = model_name) %>% 
    filter(model == ideal) %>% 
    group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
    count(cyl) %>% 
    ungroup()

fn <- function(x) {
    if(1 == 1){
        1
    } else {
        2
    }
}

p <- paste0("here is one string of text", fn, "another string of text")

x <- 
    list(c(2, 3, 5),
         c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee"),
         c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
         3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
